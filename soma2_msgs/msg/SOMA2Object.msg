string map_name 	#### the global map that the object belongs. Automatically filled by SOMA2 insert service 

string map_unique_id 	#### the unique db id of the map. Automatically filled by SOMA2 insert service

string config 		#### the corresponding world configuration. This could be incremented as config1, config2 at each meta-room observation

string mesh 		#### mesh model of the object. Could be left blank

string type 		#### type of the object. For higher level objects, this could chair1, chair2. For middle or lower level segments it could be segment1101, segment1102, etc.
