# SOMA Low-Level Sensory Datastore

This package provides a totally optional set of helper tools for the task of composing SOMA objects from individual observations of real-world objects. The tools here, provide a custom set of ROS messages and services. The classic use-case for this package being that of collecting multiple observations of a single or multiple objects before merging them into combined object models. In this use-case, the raw data and low-level segmented observations are stored in the data structures provided by this package, and are used as the source material to create high-level SOMA objects. However, the implementation of how these things are achieved -- data collection, segmentation, processing -- are all left up to the application developer.

# Messages

The messages are organised in a graph structure. The conceptual root node is the Scene message, which contains various forms of unprocessed robot perception data -- RGB-D data, odometry, arbitrary metadata etc. -- that a system may use in further processing. This represents the raw sensor output of a Robot performing some task such as taking multiple views of a surface, whereby each view would be represented as a Scene message. Multiple Scenes can be grouped together by sharing a common episode_id.

Given a `Scene`, processing such as segmentation is usually applied to extract objects. Each of these objects can be represented using the `Segment` message. There may be multiple `Segments` in a single `Scene`, and the same `Segment` representing the same object may be observed in multiple `Scenes` during a given episode. The message types support this sort of relationship. For each segment, any number of `Observations` can be attached to a `Segment`. An `Observation` represents the data produced by any processing performed on the `Scene`, and is intended to store things like cropped images and masked point clouds that describe specific observations of objects, and the `Segment` links these observations together to the same object across multiple views.

# Services

  There are multiple services designed to make it easy to insert and extract data from the database. These are generally straightforward in use, and there are examples in the /tests/ folder you can try out. The only service that may bear further explanation is `InsertSceneAuto`, which allows you to specify robot_pose and camera_info topics, and will automatically record and insert these along with ~2 seconds of output from the /tf topic to your Scene message. Recording a brief burst of /tf allows you to re-use it later and re-calculate things like frame transforms. Transforming to and from a tf transformer is very easy, see the TransformationStore class in server.py for examples. This is the recommended way of putting scenes into the database, as it requires the least amount of effort on the part of the user.

  In general, all fields in all messages are optional, and arbitrary extra relationships between messages can be encoded by using the meta_data fields, which are intended to be filled by JSON objects.

  Services are deliberately kept bare-bones, as in contrast to the main SOMA services that provide feature-rich query services, it is intended that users of the LLSD perform more complicated query tasks by using MongoDB queries.
